                  A money-back policy is a unique life insurance product
                  designed to provide both life coverage and financial support
                  during the policy term. It ensures that policyholders receive
                  regular payouts, known as survival benefits, at specified
                  intervals throughout the duration of the policy. This
                  structure not only offers a safety net for loved ones in the
                  event of the policyholder&apos;s death but also helps
                  individuals manage their financial goals and obligations
                  during their lifetime. In the unfortunate event of the
                  policyholder&apos;s demise within the policy term, the
                  beneficiaries receive the full sum assured without any
                  deductions for previously paid survival benefits, along with
                  any applicable bonuses. Additionally, premiums paid towards
                  this policy qualify for tax deductions under Section 80C of
                  the Income Tax Act, 1961, making it a financially savvy choice
                  for securing one&apos;s future.
