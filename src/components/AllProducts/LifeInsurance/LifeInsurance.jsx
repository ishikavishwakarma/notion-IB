        Life insurance is a popular choice for those looking to secure their financial future and provide for their family in case of an untimely passing. A term life insurance policy, for example, can offer essential financial protection to your loved ones. Before purchasing life insurance, it's crucial to understand how the policy works and how your beneficiaries can receive the insurance payout.

        A life insurance policy is essentially a contract between the policyholder and the insurer, where the insurance company promises to provide coverage in exchange for regular premium payments. The person insured, known as the life assured, is covered by the policy, and the policyholder may or may not be the same person. The policyholder can choose to pay the premiums on an annual, semi-annual, quarterly, or monthly schedule.</Typography>
