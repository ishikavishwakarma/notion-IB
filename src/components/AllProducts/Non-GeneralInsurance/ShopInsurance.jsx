                  Shop  Insurance offers comprehensive financial protection
                  to retail businesses by covering various risks that could
                  disrupt operations. It ensures that property damage to the

                  businesses to repair or replace assets swiftly. In case of

                  Liability coverage protects against legal claims arising from
                  customer injuries or property damage.
