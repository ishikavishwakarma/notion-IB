                Fire insurance covers damage or loss to a property because of fire. It is a specific form of insurance in addition to homeownerâ€™s or property insurance, and it covers the cost of replacement and repair or reconstruction above what the property insurance policy covers. Fire insurance policies cover damage to the property, and may also cover damage to nearby structures, personal property and costs because of not having the capacity to live in or use the property if damages occur.

The policy typically includes additional coverage against smoke or water damage due to a fire. A fire insurance policy is usually set up for one year. The policyholder may renew the policy according to the terms of the policy.
