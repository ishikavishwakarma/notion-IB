                  Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) for doctors is a
                  specialized policy designed to safeguard medical professionals
                  from the financial risks associated with their practice. It
                  offers protection against claims of negligence, mistakes, or
                  errors made during patient care that result in harm, injury,
                  or even death.
                  <br />
                  This insurance covers legal costs, compensation claims, and
                  settlements, helping doctors avoid significant financial
                  losses. Whether the issue arises from misdiagnosis, improper
                  treatment, or procedural errors, PII ensures that doctors can
                  focus on their practice without the constant fear of financial
                  repercussions from potential lawsuits. It is a vital tool in
                  maintaining professional stability and reputation.
